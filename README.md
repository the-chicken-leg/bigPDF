# Big PDFs

A big PDF contains every work instruction in either the "CyberKnife", "iDMS and Precision", or "TomoTherapy" folders within AccuraySynchronizedServiceDocuments.

With a big PDF, you can search all work instructions at the same time. A table of contents is also created.

Big PDFs are not small, but they function well enough.

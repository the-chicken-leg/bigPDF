# Big PDFs

A big PDF contains every work instruction in either the "CyberKnife", "iDMS and Precision", or "TomoTherapy" folder.

With a big PDF, you can search all work instructions at the same time. A table of contents is also created.

Big PDFs are not small, and they might stutter a bit when first opened, but they function well enough.

# Make big PDFs

Open the "big_pdf_maker.exe" file, and choose from which folder you would like to make a big PDF. You can run this program periodically to create new big-PDFs when work instructions are updated.

If there an error when trying to add a file to the big PDF, you will be notified and the file will be skipped.
